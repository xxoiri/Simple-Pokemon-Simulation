# Simple-Pokemon-Simulation

the PDF contains assignment details. I have only edited the "Tree Traversal Agent.java", the rest of the files were provided by my Professor Andrew Wood. 

To run the simulation, please enter the following commands withing the root directory.

```javac -cp "./lib/*:." @pokePA.srcs```

Then, to battle against an Easy agent:

```java -cp "./lib/*:." edu.bu.pas.pokemon.Easy```

to battle against a Medium agent:

```java -cp "./lib/*:." edu.bu.pas.pokemon.Medium```

to battle against a Hard agent:

```java -cp "./lib/*:." edu.bu.pas.pokemon.Hard```
